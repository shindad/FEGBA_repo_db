Made by Vilkalizer.
This is a repalette of the priest and cleric sprites to separate the lightest skin colour and the staff from the robe, allowing you to colour skin/robe/staff individually. (The cleric's head strap shares colours with the staff.) This is accomplished by using the three previously unused colours in the priest/cleric palettes.

The folders are:
/cleric - standard cleric
/priest - standard priest
/priest-bald - same, but without hair
/priest-buff - a bigger priest
/priest-buff-moulder - same, but with the head edited to look more like Moulder
