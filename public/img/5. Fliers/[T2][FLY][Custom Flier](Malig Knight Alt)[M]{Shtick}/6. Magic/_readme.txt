Animation made by Grated Shtick. Free to use with credit. No permission required.
This animation wasn't inspired by Camilla from Fates, if you are curious.

To put this animation in the game, go to the battle animations section FEBuilder or FEditor. (I haven't used FEditor in a while so go where you view battle anims)
Where it says import animation, upload the script and make sure to properly assign
a class to the animation.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me in the FEU discord, as that is where I am most active.
